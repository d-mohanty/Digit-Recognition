# Digit-Recognition
Recognizes Handwritten digits.
Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm is used for more accuracy.
MNIST data set is used for training the model.

# Dependencies </br>
1.cv2</br>
2.sklearn</br>
3.numpy</br>
4.skimage</br>
5.collections</br>

# Steps to be followed</br>
1.download IDLE for Python 2.7.13</br>
2.Run the Classifier.py file on IDLE which generates cls.pkl file which acts as the classifier.</br>
3.Run Recognize.py which uses cls.pkl classifier to recognize digits.</br>
4.photo_1 and photo_2 are provided on which digit recognition can work.
